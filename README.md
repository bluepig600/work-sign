# LightBoard
The LightBoard is a sign that I'm making for my dad, hopefully in time for christmas, using spare ws2815 led strips.
It will be able to function as a sign at my dad's work that can display scrolling text or animations.
It should be able to attach to the wall using those velcro sticky thingys.
The case will be white so you can see the lights through it.
I made this as I have spare led strips and I'm in need of a christmas gift for my dad.
